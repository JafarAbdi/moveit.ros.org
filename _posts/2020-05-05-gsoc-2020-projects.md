MoveIt has been selected as a mentor organization for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this summer! Google has awarded us two student positions. From the twenty applications submitted to the MoveIt project we have selected the ones from Jeroen De Maeyer and Adam Pettinger.

GSoC is an international program in which Google awards stipends to students who complete a free and open-source software coding project during a three month period. Details about the program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline).

Jeroen De Maeyer is pursuing a PhD in motion planning at the KU Leuven in Belgium. He already has extensive experience with MoveIt. His summer project will focus on Cartesian motion planning with constraints. He will add support within MoveIt for the constrained motion planning capabilities in OMPL, the default planning library in MoveIt. He also plans to add support for Cartesian path constraints to TrajOpt. He will be mentored by Felix von Drigalski ([OMRON SINIC X Corporation](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/)), Omid Heidari ([Idaho State University](https://www.isu.edu/)), and Mark Moll ([PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai/)).

Adam Pettinger is pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. His research focuses on teleoperation. He has been using and working extensively on the moveit_jog_arm package. Adamâ€™s main objective is to port moveit_jog_arm to ROS 2. In addition, he will work on the ease of use of the package, add support for different inverse kinematics methods, and attempt to make the jogger as realtime as possible. He will be mentored by Andy Zelenak and Tyler Weaver (both at [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai/)).

We are excited to see these two joining us, and making progress on these projects this summer!

And just as a reminder, make sure to join [World MoveIt Day](https://moveit.ros.org/events/world-moveit-day/2020/04/28/world-moveit-day-2020.html), a hackathon on June 2, 2020.
